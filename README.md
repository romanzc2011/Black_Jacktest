# Black_Jack
Basic game of Black Jack with UI. Works fine for a few rounds then starts messing up such as finishing game after 1 card is given to player. Restart game if happens. I will continue to search for the cause of this behavior.

- To start game press the "Deal" button and answer prompt about bet amount.
- Just use "Hit" or "Stand" during gameplay as dealer is programmed to execute its turn as soon as player executes their turn.
